# 🩸 Human Disease Blood Atlas  
Part of the **Human Protein Atlas**, focused on blood proteomes across diseases.

## 🧬 Who We Are  
A dedicated bioinformatics & proteomics team based at SciLifeLab aiming to profile and discover disease biomarkers using cutting‑edge proximity extension assays and targeted mass spectrometry across dozens of diseases.

## 📂 Our Projects  
We maintain and contribute to open-source tools that support data analysis, visualization, and machine learning for proteomics data:

- **[HDAnalyzeR](https://github.com/HDA1472/HDAnalyzeR)**  
  R package for streamlined proteome data analysis—differential expression, ML modeling, network analysis & publication‑ready plots.

> ⚠️ All repositories are forks—head to the upstream sources for the latest development.

## 🎯 Mission  
- Provide **open‑source tools** for blood‑based proteomics in disease contexts.
- Ensure **reproducibility** and **transparency** in biomarker discovery.
- Advance **statistical** and **machine learning** approaches to multi‑disease classification.

## 📊 Data  
- Protein levels for **1,162 proteins across 59 diseases** (PEA) and **146 proteins across 12 cancers** (mass‑spec).
- Cohorts include ~6,000 patients in pan‑disease studies and ~1,400 in pan‑cancer work.
